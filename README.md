## Setup
Please make sure that you are inside the folder for this repository which contains the `package.json` file before following these instructions for setup:

1. Run `npm install` in your terminal to install the dependencies from the `package.json` file.
2. Run `npm start` in your terminal to run this React app in the browser. If your browser does not automatically open the page for you, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Deliverables

We've been asked to build a website for a new pet adoption center, Flatapets, that displays a list of pets available for adoption at this pet adoption center.

Today we will learn about Components and Props to help us accomplish some tasks related to displaying data on the website.

1. In the `App.js` file, the `App` component currently returns an `<h1>` element with the text "Welcome to React!" Delete this `<h1>` element, and replace it with a `<div>` element with the `className` of "app" so that the `App` component returns this `<div>` element.
2. Create a new file called `Header.js` inside of the `components` folder. Then, inside of the `Header.js` file, create a `Header` component that will return a `<header>` element that contains the following elements inside it:
- An `<h1>` element.
- The `<h1>` element must have the text "Flatapets" inside it, as well as a `<span>` element inside it.
- The `<span>` element must have the `className` of "logo", and must have the 🐈 emoji inside it.
3. Export your `Header` component from `Header.js`. Import your `Header` component into `App.js`.
4. Render the `Header` component inside of the `<div>` element returned from the `App` component.
5. Create a new file called `PetList.js` inside of the `components` folder. Then, inside of the `PetList.js` file, create a `PetList` component that will return a `<ul>` element with the `className` of "pet-list".
6. Export your `PetList` component from `PetList.js`. Import your `PetList` component into `App.js`.
7. Render the `PetList` component inside of the `<div>` element returned from the `App` component. The `PetList` component should be rendered after the `Header` component.
8. In `App.js`, the `PetList` component should have a prop called `pets`. The value of the `pets` prop should be the value of the `pets` variable declared in the `App` component.
9. In `PetList.js`, destructure the `pets` prop in the `PetList` component.
10. In the `PetList` component, use the `.map()` array iterator to iterate over the `pets` array (prop that was passed to the `PetList` component) and create a list of `Pet` components which should be rendered inside of the `<ul>` element in the `PetList` component.
11. The `Pet` components should have a prop called `pet`. The value of the `pet` prop should be an object from the `pets` array (prop that was passed to the `PetList` component).
12. Create a `key` prop for the `Pet` components - this is necessary since we are creating a list of `Pet` components. The value of the `key` prop should be the `id` for the pet object.
13. Create a new file called `Pet.js` inside of the `components` folder. Then, inside of the `Pet.js` file, create a `Pet` component. Destructure the `pet` prop in the `Pet` component. The `Pet` component must return an `<li>` element with the `className` of "pet". This `<li>` element must contain the following elements inside it:
- An `<img>` element. The `<img>` element's `src` attribute must have the value of the pet's image. The `<img>` element's `alt` attribute must have the value of the pet's name.
- An `<h4>` element. The pet's name should display inside of this `<h4>` element.
14. Export your `Pet` component from `Pet.js`. Import your `Pet` component into `PetList.js`.

## Creating a React App

`create-react-app` will build a project folder for our application and install all the dependencies we need (via Node Package Manager).

To create a new React application and start it, run:

```
npx create-react-app app-name
cd app-name
npm start
```

In addition to React, it gives us:

- Webpack: a tool for bundling and minifying our code (along with a server for running our code in development)
- Babel: a transpiler that lets us write modern JavaScript and JSX

## Components

Components are the building blocks of React. A component is a function that:

- Takes in some raw data (props)
- Returns user interface (JSX)

There are some things you'll need to keep in mind:

- The name of your component function must be capitalized.
- A component can only return one element. That element can have children, like this:

``` javascript
function Card() {
  return (
    <div id="card1" className="card">
      <h1>Hello Flatiron!</h1>
      <p>Greetings!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Props

When you create components, one way to make them dynamic and reusable is by passing in props. For example, if we wanted to create several cards on our page using a Card component, we could do so like this:

``` javascript
function Card(props) {
  return (
    <div id="card1" className="card">
      <h1>{props.greeting}</h1>
      <p>{props.subGreeting}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <div>
    <Card greeting="Good morning!" subGreeting="Hello World!" />
    <Card greeting="Class is in session!" subGreeting="Welcome to React!" />
  </div>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

The props argument in our Card component defines an object that React will pass to our function when it is called, and it will use whatever attributes we add to our JSX component as key-value pairs on that props object.
